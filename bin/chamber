-- dig out the entry tunnel first. It'll be a simple 3 tall by 2 wide thing

-- TODO PLAN
-- After digging out the entry tunnel, go back down to the bottom leftest of the entry tunnel
-- dig one block in
-- figure out how many blocks to go left by, roughly half the width? (maybe length)
-- Go that many blocks
-- Start room digging algorithm, don't worry about overfilling I think
